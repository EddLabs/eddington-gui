In this video, we’ll see how to upload your fitting data to Eddington-GUI.

Open Eddington-GUI and click the “choose file” button. It will open a dialog that
allows you to choose which file to upload to Eddington-GUI. Choose The appropriate file
and click open.

If you choose an Excel file, Eddington-GUI will search for the first sheet with
appropriate syntax, as we’ve seen in the previous video. You can change that sheet by
clicking on the “sheet” selection dropbox. Pay attention that if you try to choose a
sheet that does not match the Eddington syntax, an error will pop-up.

Next, you’ll be able to choose which column to consider as your x-axis, x error axis,
y-axis, and y-error axis. By default, Eddington will automatically choose the first 4
columns as your data columns

To view your data points on a graph, click “Plot data.”

Thank you for watching this video. Next, we’ll see how to fit the data according to a
fitting function.
