Can't Open Eddington-GUI in Windows
-----------------------------------

On some Windows computers, Eddington-GUI fails to open due to a problem in *Matplotlib*
(`see issue here <https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/14558>`_).
In order to solve this problem install the *Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual
Studio* from `here <https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=48145>`_.
After installing, Eddington-GUI should be able to open.
