In these videos, we’ve scanned through the process of using Eddington-GUI as your data
fitting platform. We’ve seen how to install it, how a data file should look like, and
how to upload it. We’ve seen how to run the fit, how to display it in a plot, and how
to save this plot and the results to files. Lastly, we’ve seen how to select and
unselect records from the fitting, and how to upload your own fitting functions to
Eddington-GUI.

I wish you a useful experience using Eddington-GUI. A lot of effort has been made in
order to make the Eddington platform as easy to use as possible. If you find any bugs or
issues, or if you wish to propose new abilities to the Eddington platform, I strongly
encourage you to go to https://github.com/EddLabs/eddington/issues and post your ideas
and thoughts there.

I am Sagi Shadur. Thank you for watching.
