In this video, we will learn how to install Eddington GUI on your computer.
First, open your browser and enter the following address:
https://github.com/EddLabs/eddington-gui/releases/latest

This will open the latest Eddington GUI release page. Here you can see we have two
installation files: MSI file for Windows and DMG file for Mac. Choose the appropriate
file according to your operating system. I’m using Windows. Therefore I will download
the MSI file.

Once you downloaded the installation file, run it, and follow the instructions.
It may raise an error that the software is not authorized. Please ignore this error
message and download it without any worries.

Once you’ve finished installing, search for Eddington in your toolbar search box,
and you’ll see it there. Now you can use the Eddington GUI.

Thank you for watching this video. Next, I’ll show you how a fitting data file
should look.
