In this video, we’ll see how fitting data files should look like for Eddington to
read them.

Eddington accepts fitting data files in three formats: CSV, Excel and Json.

The fitting data in Excel files should be written as follows: it should have a headers’
row with a name for each column, and the following rows should contain the data to fit,
each row represents a data record.

Pay attention that you can have as many columns as you want. Once you open
Eddington-GUI, you’ll be able to choose which of them to use as your x-axis and
which as your y-axis.

Thank you for watching. In the next video, we’ll see how to upload the fitting data to
Eddington-GUI.
