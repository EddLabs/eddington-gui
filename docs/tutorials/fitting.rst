In this video, we’ll see how to fit your data according to a fitting function.

Eddington offers you an array of default fitting functions such as linear, parabolic,
hyperbolic, exponential, normal, and many others. You can choose which one of them to
use by clicking the “Fitting function” dropbox. In our example, we’ll select the
hyperbolic fitting function.

Once you choose which fitting function to use, you can press the “Fit” button and get
the fitting result. You can visualize your fitting by clicking the “Plot Fitting” button
and see how close was your fit to the data. Lastly, you can press the “Residuals” button
to see the errors of your fitting.

If you wish to add titles and labels to the axes, you simply enter them in the
designated text box, that’s located on the right of the main window. If you do not
specify a title, the title would be the fitting function. As for the axes label, the
default label would be the name of the column chosen for the x and y axes. You can also
add grid lines to the plot by checking in the “Grid” checkbox.

If you wish to save your fitting results, first choose an output directory in which you
want to save those results. Once you select the output directory, press the “Save”
button, and all your fitting results and plots will be kept there.

Thank you for watching. Next, we’ll see how to select and unselect records from your
data.
