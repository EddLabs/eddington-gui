Hello, My name is Sagi Shadur, and I’m the creator of the Eddington platform.
Eddington helps you fit data according to theoretical models, with easy to use tools
such as the Eddington python library, Eddington CLI and Eddington GUI.

Eddington is an open-source platform, and as such, it’s free to use. It’s based on other
state-of-the-art open-source projects such as numpy, scipy, matplotlib and etc.

I invite you to go to https://github.com/EddLabs/eddington/ to learn more.

In the following videos, I will show you how to install and use Eddington-GUI.
I want to thank you for choosing Eddington as your data fitting platform and wish you
a good experience using it.
